Introduction to Regular Expressions
============

Regular expressions express a language defined by a regular grammar that can be solved with a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA), where the match is represented by the states.

A regular grammar is the simplest grammar expressed by the Chomsky Hierarchy.

![Alt text](/img1.png?raw=true "img1")

In a nutshell, a regular language is expressed visually so it can express an NFA, and here is a very simple example of an NFA:

![Alt text](/img2.png?raw=true "img2")

And the Regular Expression language is a textual representation of such an automaton. That last example is expressed by the following regex:

```bash
‚û• ^[01]*1$
```

Which matches any string starting with 0 or 1 , repeating 0 or more times, ending with 1 . In other words, it's a regular expression to match odd numbers from their binary representation.

Everything you will learn about regular expressions
-----------



What are regular expressions?
-----------

Regular expressions are character patterns that allow you to select or discard data in a text file such as csv, or in a line or an input, depending on whether or not they match this pattern.



Applications of regular expressions
-----------

Regular expressions allow us to build patterns, which we can apply to files, and search for relevant information in them, a practical case (among many others) would be, extract from an SD card, the photographs taken on a certain date, or the precise and concise search of files in computer forensics.


Introduction to the regular expression language
-----------

/d -> Digit
/w -> Letter

* Shape
* give repetition

The language: characters, operators, and constructions
============

The character .
-----------

The character (.)

Text file. Series of character strings. A succession of lines.

Character string. A character followed by another character, followed by another character.

Character. Graphic representation in bits of some code, in most cases ASCII. It is the minimum unit that can be abstracted from a character string.

Predefined and built classes
-----------

| Regex	 | What does this? | Description | Reverse |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| . | Character | Any character, select each of the characters |  |
| /d | Digit| Digits: (lowercase d) Find all digits (number) from 0 to 9, it is | \D | 
| /w | Word| All word characters, Finds all the characters that are part of a word, both letters (lower or upper case) and numbers, it is equivalent to putting [a-zA-Z0-9_].| \W | 
| /s | Space| WhiteSpaces, Finds all spaces (line breaks and tabs are also spaces). | \S | 
| [0-9] | Specific Digit| Find all the digits from 0 to 9. |  | 
| [0-9a-zA-Z] | Specific Word Character | Find all characters that are from 0-9 or that are uppercase or lowercase letters (\w) |  | 
| [a-zA-Z]	 | | It will find us only the letters, both uppercase and lowercase. | | 
| \	 | Diagonal invertida| Escapes characters, allows a special character to be displayed
 |  | 

The delimiters: +, *, ?
-----------

 * '*' ‚Üí Whether or not there is [Select all, operator greedy]


 Example: 
 ```
 \d*[a-tA-T]
```

It reads: Select the character that is in the range from __a__ to __t__, (both lowercase and uppercase) and ALL the numbers that precede it, WHETHER THEY EXIST OR NOT.

So, from the following example you will select


~~12345T exto

12345~~Te~~x~~to~~


 * '+' ‚ÜíThere is one or more [There must be]

Example: 
 ```
\d+[a-tA-T]
```


It reads: Select the sequences of characters that contain AT LEAST ONE digit, followed by a character that is in the range from __a__ to __t__, (Both lowercase and uppercase).

So from the following example you will select

~~12345T~~exto

12345 _Te_ x _to_



 * '?' ‚ÜíThere is zero or one (There can be only one)

Example: 
 ```
\d?[a-tA-T]
```

It reads: Select the sequences of characters THAT CONTAIN OR NOT, A SINGLE digit, followed by a character that is in the range from __a__ to __t__, (Both lowercase and uppercase).

So from the following example you will select


1234~~5Te~~x~~to~~

12345~~Te~~x~~to~~


Complex example: \[[a-zA-Z]*:?@+[a-zA-Z]*\]

It reads: Select the sequences of characters that:

* Start with the special character [
* They then contain, or not, a sequence of letters, both lowercase and uppercase.
* They then contain, or not, a single character:
* They then contain at least one @
* They then contain, or not, a sequence of letters, both lowercase and uppercase.
* End with the special character ]

So from the following example you will select

_[LOG ENTRY] [LOG] Everything is OK_

_[LOG ENTRY] [LOG] [:@beco] Logged in_

_[LOG ENTRY] [LOG] [USER:@beco] Clicked here_

_[LOG ENTRY] [LOG] [user@@@@] Rated the app_

_[LOG ENTRY] [LOG] [user:@beco] Logged out_

_[LOG ENTRY] [LOG] [user:beco] test_

Counters
-----------

* '{,}' ‚Üí The ¬´counters¬ª or also known as quantifiers allow to specify the number of appearances that a character or pattern can have within a regular expression, the syntax to use is.

Syntax for the use of metacharacters and quantifiers


 Example: 
 ```
\d{lower bound, upper bound}
```

* Lower Dimension: Allows you to indicate the minimum number of appearances of a character or pattern.

* Upper Dimension: Allows you to indicate the maximum number of appearances of a character or pattern, this dimension works together with the upper dimension which becomes a range of possible appearances.

With the above established, we can continue on the path of salvation and continue with the evangelization of ¬´evil regular expressions üòà¬ª, to understand the use of counters it is necessary to understand the following rules.


* Counter {x}

This option allows you to indicate an infinite range of incidents which will start from the number indicated in the lower bound.

As shown in the example above, using the "{x,}" syntax does not care about issues that appear after the lower bound condition is met.

Expression
 ```
\d{2}
```

Text

AB1

AB~~89~~



* Counter {x,}

This option allows you to indicate an infinite range of incidents which will start from the number indicated in the lower bound.

Expression
 ```
\d{2,}
```

~~1234567890~~

~~1234567~~ui~~5678~~

As shown in the example above, using the "{x,}" syntax does not care about issues that appear after the lower bound condition is met.


* Counter {x,y}


This option uses the lower bound (x) as the upper bound (y) this allows to indicate a range of appearances of a character or pattern which can be translated as ‚Äúbetween ‚Äúx‚Äù and ‚Äúy‚Äù times‚Äù this notation is the most common that the community is run.


Expression
 ```
\d{2,5}
```
~~1~~
~~12~~
~~123~~
~~1234~~
~~12345~~
~~12345~~6



As shown in the previous example, we can use the 2 dimensions which allow us to establish the range of possible appearances of a character or pattern. If we compare this with the previous variant, we can see that in this case there is a limitation.

The case of (?) as a delimiter
-----------

the character ? is a delimiter when preceded by +, to find the smallest possible occurrence. If it does not have the plus, it is no longer a delimiter but a zero-once-occurrence symbol.

Uses of ?

* To express that there may or may not be a certain character example: \d[a-zA-z]? (Indicates search for a digit and then there may or may not be a letter)

* As a delimiter, ie; search for the smallest possible groups according to the given condition example: \d\d+? (Look for subgroups of two numbers)


Not (^), its use and its dangers
-----------

The ^ sign is called: Circumflex accent

This only serves as a negation if it is inside a [ ]

Challenge: Filtering out letters in phone numbers using negations
-----------

Expression
 ```
(\d{2}\W?){3}
```


Beginning (^) and end of line ($)
-----------

the ^ is used to indicate the beginning of a line
the $ is used to indicate end of line

^ ------------- $

Note: The match is an entire line or it is discarded

Practical use of Regular Expressions
============


Logs
-----------

* To find IP addresses:

Expression
 ```
(\d{1,3}\.){3,3}(\d{1,3})

```

* To find lines about HTTP methods:

Expression
 ```
(\d{1,3}\.){3,3}(\d{1,3})

```

* To search for lines with arrows in the format of(number)/month(name)/year(number):

Expression

 ```
^.*(\d{1,2}\/\w+\/\d{4,4}).*$
```

Perl
-----------


 ```Perl
$ cat parsea.pl
#!/usr/bin/perl


use warnings;
my $t = time;
$match = 0;
$nomatch = 0;



open (CMD,"./result.csv");


while ($line = <CMD>) {
        if ($line =~ /^(\d+\-\d+\-\d+),(.*),(.*),(\d+),(\d+),(.*),(.*),(.*),(TRUE|FALSE)/) {
                $date=$1;
                $home_team=$2;
                $away_team=$3;
                $home_score=$4;
                $away_score=$5;
                $tournament=$6;
                $city=$7;
                $country=$8;
                $neutral=$9;
                if ($home_score > $away_score) {
                        $year = $date;
                        $year =~ s/(\d+)\-\d+\-\d+/$1/;
                        print "$year - $home_team ($home_score) - $away_team ($away_score)\n";
                }
                #print "*$line";
                $match++;
        } else {
                #print $line;
                $nomatch++;
        }


}

print "se encontraron $match\n";
print "no se encontraron $nomatch\n";
print "tardo:".(time()-$t)."\n";

```

this part is very interesting:


```Perl
$year =~ s/(\d+)\-\d+\-\d+/$1/;
```

Php
-----------


Match for regular expressions in PHP:

```Php
preg_match( '/regex/',
		$line,
		$m)
```

where:

* regex: is the regular expression.

* $line: string of characters (each line of the file).

* $m: array where each match will go in each of the places. In the script, this array has two elements where element [0] is the test string and element [1] is the group of characters to match.

* Regular expression to get games played in January 2018:

```bash
^2018\-01\-(\d\d),.*$

```

Code

```Php
<?php
$file = fopen("../files/results.csv","r");

$match   = 0;
$nomatch = 0;

while(!feof($file)) {
    $line = fgets($file);
    if(preg_match(
        '/^2018\-01\-(\d\d),.*$/',
        $line,
        $m
      )
    ) {
        print_r($m); 
        $match++;
    } else {
        $nomatch++;
    }
}
fclose($file);

printf("\n\nmatch: %d\nnomatch: %d\n", $match, $nomatch);
```

Using PHP in practice
-----------

```Php
<?php
$t = time();
$file = fopen("../results.csv", "r");
$match = 0;
$nomatch = 0;

while(!feof($file)) {
  $line = fgets($file);
  // 1910-04-10,Netherlands,Belgium,7,0,Friendly,Haarlem,Netherlands,FALSE
  if(preg_match('/^(\d{4,4}\-\d{2,2}\-\d{2,2}).*?,(.*?),(.*?),(\d+),(\d+),.*$/', $line, $m)) {
    if($m[5] > $m[4]) {
      printf("(%s) - %s (%d) - (%d) %s\n",$m[1], $m[2], $m[4], $m[5], $m[3]);
      $match++;
    } else {
      $nomatch++;
    }
  } 
}

fclose($file);
printf("Para los equipos como visitantes se encontraron\n - %d ganados \n - %d perdidos\n", $match, $nomatch);
printf("Tiempo en ejecutar: %d segundos\n", time()-$t);
```
